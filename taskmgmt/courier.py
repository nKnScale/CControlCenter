"""Deliver queued agent-to-agent messages into the agents' panes.

Until this existed the queue was write-only: `dashboard/seed_queue.py` appended to
~/.agentmux/queue/<sender>.jsonl, the dashboard rendered it, and nothing ever handed
a message to its recipient. Every exchange had to be relayed by the orchestrator.

The courier closes that loop. It tails each outbox, and for every record carrying a
`recipient` it runs `agentmux send <recipient> <text>`.

Design decisions that are easy to get wrong, so they are stated here:

* **A new outbox starts at EOF, not at byte 0.** ~/.agentmux/queue already holds the
  seeded 2026-09-19 traffic. Starting from the beginning would type dozens of stale
  hand-offs into live agents the first time the courier ever ran. `--from-start`
  overrides it deliberately.
* **The cursor is (dev, ino, offset).** A rotated or truncated outbox is a different
  file or a shorter one; either way the offset is meaningless and reading from it
  would deliver garbage or replay. Both cases reset to 0 and are logged.
* **Undeliverable messages spill to pending.jsonl rather than blocking the outbox.**
  In-order delivery per outbox sounds right until one dead recipient stalls that
  sender's traffic to everybody else. The spill keeps per-recipient order (a new
  message queues behind anything already pending for the same recipient) without the
  head-of-line block across recipients.
* **A give-up is reported through the queue itself**, as sender `courier` with a null
  recipient. It shows up in the dashboard's Message Queue view like any other
  message, and a null recipient means the courier will never try to deliver its own
  error - which is what stops a failure loop.
* **`send` is never forced.** Its modal guard exists because Enter into a codex
  "Update available" prompt once ran npm install and took an agent down. A pane
  showing a prompt is simply a delivery that has not succeeded yet.

Usage:
    python3 taskmgmt/courier.py --once        # one pass, exit
    python3 taskmgmt/courier.py --watch       # loop until killed
    python3 taskmgmt/courier.py --status      # what it would do, delivers nothing
