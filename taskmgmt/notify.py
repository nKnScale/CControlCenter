"""Getting a person's attention when the harness needs it.

THE GAP THIS FILLS. run.py::record_notice already journals and writes the orchestrator
inbox, and its docstring names the bug it was written for: "The one message whose entire
purpose is to reach a human was the one that could vanish silently." But both of those
destinations are files. Nothing read them except the dashboard, if it happened to be
open, on the right tab. A run that stops and waits for an operator who is not looking
waits forever, and the operator gate in front of completion made that the normal case
rather than the rare one.

THE RULE HERE: A NOTIFICATION IS NEVER THE RECORD. The ledger is the record. Every
channel below is allowed to fail, is bounded in time, and reports its failure rather
than raising - because a toast that could not be drawn must never be able to stop a run
from completing. `deliver()` returns what happened on each channel and the caller
decides whether that is worth saying out loud.

WHY NO TRANSPORT IS BUNDLED. There is no ntfy client, no Pushover, no SMTP, no webhook.
Those are opinions about someone else's infrastructure and each one is a dependency,
a credential store and a failure mode this repo would then own. Instead there is one
command hook: a program of your choosing, handed the subject and body on stdin. Wire it
to whatever you already use.

WHAT IS WORTH INTERRUPTING SOMEONE FOR is decided by the caller, not here, but the bar
is stated once so it stays consistent: a run that has stopped and is waiting on a
person, a card that has been parked after three failed reviews, an agent that died
mid-job, and a whole orchestration finishing. Not per-job progress, not spawns, not
passing verdicts. A notification you did not need is annoying in a way that accumulates,
and the cost of that is the ones you do need being ignored.

NO CHILD SPAWNED HERE MAY INHERIT STDIN. Every subprocess below passes stdin= - either
DEVNULL or a pipe via input= - and none may be written without it. subprocess gives a
child the PARENT's stdin when the argument is omitted, and capture_output=True does not
change that: it redirects 1 and 2 only. That default ate a caller alive. Scripts here
are fed to bash on stdin (`bash -s`, and `wsl.py run`, which is the mandated way to
reach WSL from Windows); bash reading a non-seekable stdin consumes one line at a time
precisely so a child CAN read the rest, so powershell.exe drew its toast and then read
the remainder of the script to EOF. Bash saw end-of-input and exited 0 with half the
script never run - a run-lifecycle script died immediately after the verdict that fires
the "waiting on your review" notice, twice, and looked like a clean success both times.
A notification that silently truncates the work that triggered it is the exact inversion
of this module's one rule: the notification is never the record, and it is never the
event either.
