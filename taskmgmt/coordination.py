"""Work claims, dependency declarations, and the shared journal.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Three agents on one repo with unrestricted permissions will, given the chance, edit the
same file at the same time. Nothing in the harness stopped that: the message queue
carried conversation, and conversation is not coordination. An agent could announce "I
am editing courier.py" into a pane and another agent could simply not be listening.

So a claim is a FILE, taken atomically, not a message. `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` means exactly
one agent wins a race; the loser is told who holds it and since when. The broadcast that
follows is a courtesy for humans and for agents that are paying attention - it is not
what provides the mutual exclusion.

Claims carry a LEASE. An agent that crashes, is killed, or simply wanders off must not
hold a file forever, so every claim expires and an expired claim is takeable. The
default is deliberately short enough that a forgotten claim clears itself within an hour
and long enough that real work is not interrupted.

DEPENDENCIES are declarations, not locks: "my work on X assumes Y". They are recorded on
the claim and reported by `claims`, so an agent about to touch Y can see who is relying
on it. Enforcing them would mean building a scheduler; surfacing them costs nothing and
catches the common case, which is two agents unknowingly pulling in opposite directions.

def take_generation(resource, path):
    """Take the exclusive right to REMOVE OR REPLACE the file currently at `path`.

    Three code paths end in the same claim file being unlinked or replaced - a steal
    of an expired claim, a renewal by its holder, and a release - and every one of
    them has to be serialised against the other two, not merely against itself. Each
    on its own re-reads and compares before acting, and a comparison followed by an
    unlink is two syscalls with a scheduler in between.

    The name of the token is the INODE that was observed, so it is per GENERATION of
    the file: whoever is working from a stale read loses the token and re-reads, and
    two processes that observed different generations never contend at all.

    Returns (token, observed_inode):
      - (Path, ino)           you own this generation; call drop_generation(token)
      - (GENERATION_LOST, x)  somebody else owns it; re-read and retry
      - (None, x | None)      the inode could not be read, or the token could not be
                              created for a reason other than contention, so there is
                              nothing to serialise on; the caller proceeds as it did
                              before this mechanism existed rather than refusing.

    AN flock, NOT AN O_EXCL CREATE, and that is the difference between a lock and a
    booby trap. Exclusive creation makes the FILE the lock, so a process SIGKILLed
    between taking the token and dropping it leaves the file behind - and since inode
    numbers are recycled, that leftover name refuses a future generation of an
    unrelated claim, permanently, until somebody notices a `.steal.` file in
    CLAIMS_DIR and deletes it. The obvious repair is worse than the disease: deciding
    that a lock file is stale is exactly the check-then-act race this whole mechanism
    exists to remove.

    An advisory lock has no such question in it. The kernel releases it when the fd
    closes, including when the process dies for any reason, SIGKILL included, so
    there is no staleness to adjudicate. The token returned is the open FD; dropping
    it is a close.

    The empty lock FILES do survive, one per generation that was ever contended, and
    they are deliberately not unlinked: removing a lock file while holding its lock is
    the classic way to end up with two holders, because a process that opened the old
    path before the unlink locks an inode nobody else can reach. They are zero bytes,
    they are named `.steal.*` so `all_claims()`'s `*.json` glob never sees them, and
    an unlocked one blocks nothing.

            #      reach this line at all; and
