"""Runs: assignment, verified completion, and the gate that holds it shut.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Multi-agent work had no completion protocol. A brief told a worker to print
"ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE" into its pane and the orchestrator grepped for it; the wording
changed per run and nothing validated it. Nothing verified work before it was delivered,
and nothing ever closed an agent - so context grew until someone remembered to kill it.

A run is an explicit boundary. Every job inside it is verified by a reviewer that is not
the worker, and `run complete` REFUSES until every job is verified. That refusal is the
whole point: it is a mechanism, not a convention, in the same spirit as a claim being an
O_EXCL file rather than a polite request.

WHY APPEND-ONLY
---------------
The obvious design - one mutable runs/<id>.json - has a lost update. Two workers submit
at the same time: both read, both write, one submission is gone. With a gate that waits
for every job, a lost `submit` hangs the run forever, and a lost `reject` lets a bad job
sit as still-in-flight and be re-verified. There is no flock anywhere in this repo.

So state is never stored, only derived. events.jsonl is append-only; a single write under
O_APPEND is atomic, and every record is capped so it stays that way. Concurrent writers
both survive; `status` folds the log. A torn final line is discarded on parse, exactly as
courier.parse_record already does for outboxes. Long text never goes in an event - it
goes in a sidecar file and the event carries the filename.

COMPLETE is taken with O_CREAT|O_EXCL, so completion cannot fire twice however many
orchestrators, retries or resumed sessions race for it.

    """Serialise the read-decide-write windows that the append-only log cannot.

    Appends are atomic, so the LEDGER is always consistent. The decisions taken from
    it are not: `complete` folds the events, checks the gate, and only then takes the
    COMPLETE marker, and `verdict` folds, computes `verdict-N.md` and only then
    appends. Both are read-decide-write across a shared file.

    Two consequences, both observed rather than theoretical in shape:
      * a `verdict --fail` landing between complete's fold and its COMPLETE marker
        completes a run with a rejected job in it - the gate reports "all verified"
        about a state that no longer exists;
      * two reviewers verdicting different jobs at the same attempt number compute the
        same `verdict-N.md` and one silently overwrites the other's reasoning.

    mkdir is atomic everywhere this runs. The stale-lock ceiling matters because an
    agent killed mid-verdict must not wedge every later completion.

    WHO HOLDS IT, NOT HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN THERE.
    ---------------------------------------------
    The first version broke any lock older than ten seconds, unconditionally. Ten
    seconds is not a long time: a verdict writing a long reason file over /mnt, or a
    fold on a run with a few hundred events, can take longer. So the lock was taken
    away from a LIVE holder and two writers ran the read-decide-write window
    concurrently - precisely the race this exists to prevent, now arriving on a
    schedule instead of by chance.

    It was worse than a single overlap. The breaker took the lock for itself, and
    when the original holder finished it removed the BREAKER's lock, letting a third
    writer in behind it. One slow verdict could unlock the run for everyone.

    So the question is whether the holder is still there. A lock naming a pid that no
    longer exists is broken at once - an agent killed mid-verdict must not wedge every
    later completion, which was the original and correct reason for a ceiling. A lock
    naming a LIVE pid is waited for, up to LOCK_CEILING_S, because no healthy fold
    takes five minutes and something has to give if one wedges; that break says so on
    stderr rather than happening silently.

    A lock that records no owner at all gets LOCK_WAIT_S. That window is real but
    microscopic - between mkdir and the write of `owner` - and treating it as
    abandoned is the mistake that made the dispatch pool's pidfile claim useless
    (ten concurrent starts, eight winners). It is re-checked every tick, so a claim in
    progress is seen as soon as it lands.

    Release is conditional for the same reason: we remove the lock only if it is still
    ours. Whoever broke it owns it now.
