# Agent lifecycle: reap, kill, the close-out marker, and the inbox archive.
#   bash <(tr -d '\r' < dashboard/test_lifecycle.sh)
#
# WHY. Every check here is a TOCTOU or a silent drop on state that is expensive to
# lose, and all four shapes had already been fixed once somewhere else in this repo
# before being found again here:
#
#   #15  reap checks liveness, then makes two Jira/Confluence calls with a 90s ceiling
#        each, then deletes. Agent names are ROLES - claude, rev, codex are respawned
#        constantly - so a respawn inside that three-minute window had its LIVE
#        sidecars deleted.
#   #16  kill, reap and the dashboard reaper all closed the same agent out. Each
#        checked a marker and then wrote it, and both shell paths then deleted the
#        marker microseconds later as part of the sidecar sweep. Result: duplicate
#        close-out comments and duplicate Confluence reports on a real ticket.
#   #20  kill swept the sidecars whether or not kill-session succeeded, leaving a LIVE
#        agent with no .cli, no .task and nothing the dashboard could say about it.
#   #18  inbox --clear os.replace'd onto a fixed .read name, so the second clear
#        destroyed what the first preserved. The comment promised recoverability; it
#        held for exactly one generation, and clearing twice is the normal case.
#
# These use a real tmux session on the agentmux socket, because `have` is the thing
# under test and faking it would test the fake.
