# PREVIOUS server answers that curl and the check passes. Measured: with a server
# that dies instantly on "Address already in use", the old script printed
# "up: http://127.0.0.1:8787 (pid ...)" and exited 0, naming a pid that was
# already gone.
#
# That is not a cosmetic lie. A suite restarts the dashboard onto a throwaway home
# to isolate itself; if the restart silently leaves the operator's server holding
# the port, every write in that suite lands on the operator's real board while the
# run believes it is isolated. run_tests.sh already re-checks this after each of
# its own restarts - the verification belongs here, where the restart is.
