"""The task-management domain: keys, the full task record, gates and queries.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The Control Center board stored a title, a status, an agent and an integer primary
key. That is a list, not a task management system. An integer primary key is not an
identifier anybody can say out loud, write in a commit message, or put in a branch
name - it is a row number, it is not stable across a restore from backup, and two
boards both have a task 7.

This mirrors the identifier and record model of the bytedesk-marketplace
`task-management` plugin (ByteDeskAI/bytedesk-marketplace), which solves exactly
that: every entity carries a minted, zero-padded, never-reused key - EP-001,
TM-014, ADR-0007, SP-002, CAP-0003 - and a record rich enough that the key is worth
having. Same prefixes, same padding, same status vocabulary, same gate semantics.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT
------------------------------
Upstream persists one markdown file per entity and derives an index. Here the store
is SQLite in `cc.db`, because that is what every existing Control Center endpoint,
the CLI and the test suites already read, and because `dashboard/SPEC_CC.md` binds
this project to the Python 3 standard library with no pip. So:

  * `nextId` reads a directory for max+1 under a file lock. Here a `board_counters`
    row is bumped inside the same transaction as the insert, which is stronger:
    the number cannot be handed out twice even under concurrent writers, and it is
    never reused after a delete because the counter only ever moves forward.
  * Upstream soft-deletes by writing `status: deleted` into the file. That is kept
    exactly - `delete` sets the status, the row stays, and the key stays burned.

The vocabularies below are the upstream ones verbatim. They are duplicated in
app.js and in coordination.py; all three must agree or a value one accepts is
rejected by another, which is the failure smoke.sh already guards for statuses.
