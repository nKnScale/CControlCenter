"""Runs, read-only, for the dashboard - plus the one human gate in front of completion.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The run gate in taskmgmt/run.py decides whether work is finished, and
until now it had no HTTP surface at all: nothing under dashboard/ ever opened
~/.agentmux/runs/. You could watch panes scroll and read the journal, but the question
an operator actually has during a run - what is blocking completion, and who is it
waiting on - could only be answered by running `agentmux run status` in a terminal.

THE RULE THIS MODULE OBEYS. It never re-implements the fold. run.fold() is the single
answer to "what happened in this run", derived from an append-only log, and a second
implementation here would be a second answer that drifts from the first. Everything
below imports run.py and calls it. For the same reason this module never writes
events.jsonl directly: run.append_event is O_APPEND with records bounded by EVENT_MAX
so one append is atomic, and a second writer that does not share that discipline breaks
the guarantee the whole design rests on. Where an event is needed, run.append_event
writes it.

# An orchestrating AGENT can verify every job and still be wrong about whether the work
# was what was wanted. A reviewer verdict answers "was the job done"; it cannot answer
# "was that the right job", because the same orchestrator wrote the brief the reviewer
# is checking against. So a run driven by the CCC orchestrator stops here and waits for
# a person, who reads the diff and says yes.
#
# The approval PINS BYTES. run.digest() exists because a verdict naming files without
# hashing them describes bytes that may since have changed; approval has the same
# exposure and a worse consequence, being the last gate. An approval records the digest
# of every submitted file, and completion re-digests and refuses if anything moved.
# Otherwise "approved" only ever meant "approved something".

# The approval itself lives in run.py, which owns the run directory and the gate that
# reads it. Keeping a second copy here would give the gate and the surface that drives
# it two definitions of what an approval is, and they would drift.
