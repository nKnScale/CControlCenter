#
# THE BUG THIS GUARDS. A browser reload opens a fresh EventSource per pane while the
# previous ones are still established; the server cannot tell a client has gone until it
# next tries to write. Seven panes over a couple of reloads consumed all sixteen slots,
# and three panes then sat at HTTP 503 rendering nothing — which looks exactly like a
# dead agent. Each agent now holds at most one stream (server.py: claim_stream /
# stream_superseded), so the ceiling is the agent count rather than the reload count.
#
# WHY THIS WAS NOT IN THE GATE. It was written, it worked, and nothing ran it - and a
# suite nothing invokes is decoration, the same standard test_testlib.sh is held to.
# Registering it meant a summary line, a skip that is not a failure, an address that
# is not nailed to one port, and waits that are polls rather than sleeps.
#
# AND THE THING THAT MATTERED MORE THAN ALL FOUR: AS WRITTEN IT COULD NOT FAIL.
# Measured, not assumed - run against a copy of the tree with stream_superseded()
# stubbed to `return False`, the original passed exactly as it did unmodified.
#
# Two reasons, and both had to go:
#
#   1. THE STORM WAS SMALLER THAN THE POOL. Four rounds was written when the author
#      had seven panes open. Against the two agents run_tests.sh spawns it is 8 opens
#      against a pool of 16 - nothing to exhaust. Rounds are derived from the pool
#      size and the live agent count now.
#   2. IT WAITED OUT THE EVIDENCE. An abandoned stream is reaped anyway when the next
#      heartbeat write fails, so "are the streams back?" is answered YES after fifteen
#      seconds whether or not the fix exists. The generation mechanism is not what
#      makes the slots come back - it is what stops them being taken in the first
#      place. So the probe happens IMMEDIATELY after the storm and inside the
#      heartbeat window, and if the box was too slow for that the suite says it
#      proved nothing rather than claiming a pass.
