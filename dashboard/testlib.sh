#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Two reasons, and the second is the important one.
#
# 1. Five suites had each grown their own `ok`/`bad`/`check`/`rc_is`/`check_rc`, with
#    different names for the same thing. Writing a test in one suite and pasting it
#    into another produced "rc_is: command not found" - which happened.
#
# 2. Every real defect found on 2026-09-22 was found by a CONCURRENCY or PROPERTY test,
#    not by an example test and not by reading:
#      - `cmd_claim` produced two winners under a 16-way race
#      - `inbox --clear` lost messages that arrived while it printed
#      - the claim race only surfaced at all because an unrelated change shifted timing
#    Those two shapes - "exactly one winner" and "nothing was lost" - are the tools that
#    work here, so they belong in the toolbox rather than being reinvented per suite.
#
# THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES: a concurrency test that cannot prove it was concurrent
# is decoration. `assert_no_loss` fails if the interleave did not happen, because the
# first version of that test passed vacuously - the writer finished before the
# destructive operation even started, and it looked green.

# Count JSON lines in a file that may not exist.
#
# `grep -c` prints a count AND returns non-zero when that count is zero, so a naive
# `|| printf 0` appends a second zero. The `[ -f ]` guard only covered the MISSING
# file; for a file that exists and is empty - which is what `: >` and mktemp produce,
# i.e. the common case - grep printed 0, exited 1, the `||` fired, and this returned
# the two-line string "0\n0".
#
# Measured: `[ "$n" = "0" ]` was then FALSE, `[ "$n" -eq 0 ]` and `$(( n + 1 ))` were
# syntax errors. assert_no_loss sums two of these, so it died on any empty artifact.
# Take grep's output, drop its exit status, and default only when there is no output.

# ("       3") where GNU prints "3", and `check` above compares with string `=`,

# no-op on GNU, so both platforms produce the same bytes.
