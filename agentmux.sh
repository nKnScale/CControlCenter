# Auth method resolution.
#
# WHY A HELPER RATHER THAN A CASE BLOCK: the set of auth methods is data
# (dashboard/auth.json), so the harness must not hardcode which ones exist. It asks
# the manifest what a method needs, and gets back shell-ready exports plus any extra
# CLI flags.
#
# Secrets are NOT returned. A method's secret env var names are declared in the
# manifest and their VALUES live in $ROOT/env (0600), which is sourced into the pane
# separately - so a key never passes through this variable, this script's output, or
# the tmux command line.
#
# Prints:  <flags>\t<exports>
# Returns: 1 if the method is unknown or not fully configured.

# Does the pane currently show a blocking prompt that is NOT the agent's normal input?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `send` appends Enter, so sending text while a modal is up actuates the
# modal's default rather than talking to the agent. That is not theoretical: a codex
# "Update available! 1. Update now / Press enter to continue" prompt appeared on a fresh
# spawn, a routine `send` landed on it, and Enter selected "Update now" — which ran
# npm install and took the agent down mid-session.
#
# Matching the LAST few lines only, because these prompts live at the bottom of the pane
# and the same words appear harmlessly in scrollback.
# The patterns below are in three groups, and the second and third exist because the
# first was not enough. Measured 2026-09-22 on a fresh `claude` pane: it shows THREE
# modals in a row - folder trust, bypass-permissions consent, then an Opus effort
# recommendation - and none of them matched. `send` typed into the second one, Enter
# selected its default of "No, exit", and the agent died. That is bug 30 all over
# again on a different CLI, so the guard now covers the shapes rather than one CLI's
# wording:
#
#   1. explicit question forms  - the original set
#   2. confirm/cancel footers   - "Enter to confirm", "Esc to cancel"
#   3. a SELECTED option line   - a caret or arrow followed by an answer word, or by
#                                 a numbered choice
#
# Group 3 needs care: `❯` and `›` are also the IDLE input prompts of claude and codex.
# It only fires when the marker is followed by an answer-shaped word or "N.", which an
# empty prompt never is.
#
# Matching the LAST few lines only, because these prompts live at the bottom of the pane
# and the same words appear harmlessly in scrollback.
# Split in two so the PATTERN can be tested without a tmux server or a real CLI:
# modal_text takes the text, modal_prompt supplies it from a pane.
# dashboard/test_modal_guard.sh exercises modal_text against captured samples.
# Four of the alternatives below were added when gemini was wired in, after two
# of these screens were measured slipping through and taking the Enter:
#
#   claude's THEME PICKER - its selector sits above the eight-line window this
#     inspects, and the visible tail is only a syntax-highlighting preview, so
#     there is no marker and no question to match. `syntax theme:` is the only
#     thing on screen that identifies it.
#   gemini's TERMS screen - same shape, and its footer says `(Use Enter to
#     select)` rather than anything resembling a question. Matched on gemini's
#     full literal heading rather than a bare `terms of service`, which an agent
#     could plausibly write while working on a legal page.
#
# `↑/↓ to navigate` and the ●/○ radio markers come from gemini's selection
# dialogs generally. All four are strings a TUI draws, not prose an agent would
# write, which is what keeps the false-positive half of test_modal_guard.sh green.

#
# modal_decision exists because trust and bypass consent are choices, not nuisances.
# On a machine where the operator has decided "every agent I spawn runs unrestricted
# in a repo I own", being asked again on every spawn is not safety, it is a pane that
# waits hours for a click. So the operator can record the decision once, per KIND of
# prompt, and unblock answers that kind on their behalf from then on.
#
# What keeps this from being "click through everything":
#   - only the kinds listed in CONSENT_KINDS, each matched on the exact text its CLI
#     draws and answered with keys verified against a live pane;
#   - granting needs a human: refused inside any agent pane, refused without a TTY,
#     and the kind must be typed back to confirm - so no agent can grant itself;
#   - the grant file is ~/.agentmux/consent.json, 0600 and not a symlink, or it is
#     ignored and nothing is answered (fail closed);
#   - every consented answer is appended to consent.log with the agent and the time.

  # The gap between the text and the Enter.
  #
  # tmux itself orders these: both go to the same server queue. The wait is for the
  # CLIENT - a TUI reading a bracketed paste needs to have consumed it before Enter

  # on every single delivery; at a 100ms courier interval it became the largest
  # remaining cost. Tunable, and lower for a single line, which no TUI needs time to
  # reassemble.
  # LENGTH MATTERS AS MUCH AS NEWLINES, and only newlines were being counted.
  #
  # The gap below exists because a TUI reading a bracketed paste has to consume it
  # before Enter arrives. But a TUI decides what a paste IS by the size of the burst,
  # not by whether it contains a newline: codex turns any large single line into a
  # "[Pasted Content NNNN chars]" placeholder in its composer. At the single-line gap
  # of 0.08s the Enter arrived mid-assembly and did nothing, so the brief sat in the
  # composer unsent, looking exactly like an agent that had ignored it. Measured on

  #
  # IT USED TO STOP LOOKING TOO SOON. Two checks 0.4s apart, and the loop broke on

# ── idle agents ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# An agent nobody is using still holds a CLI process, a provider session and, if it
# was spawned unrestricted, a shell with the approval bypass turned off. Leaving one
# up for days is how a `dev` pane sits at 3.4 hours of zero activity with an
# unrestricted codex behind it, which is what prompted this.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS "NO USE": the later of tmux's `session_activity` (client input) and
# `window_activity` (pane output) - see cmd_idle for why session_activity alone is wrong. That is the honest signal - it moves when
# the agent is thinking out loud, when it prints a result, and when anyone types at
# it. It is NOT wall-clock uptime: a busy agent that has been running for six hours
# is in use, and a fresh one that has done nothing for an hour is not.
#
# WHAT IT WILL NOT DO:
#   - kill an ATTACHED session. Somebody has it on screen; the fact that they have
#     not typed for an hour is not permission to close their terminal.
#   - kill anything when tmux cannot be queried. A failed query is indistinguishable
#     from an idle session, and guessing in that direction ends a live agent.
#   - kill silently. Every timeout goes through cmd_kill, so the bound Jira issue is

# forever. Every later run then refused to start, reporting a port conflict that did
# not exist, and the only way out was hunting the holder with fuser.
